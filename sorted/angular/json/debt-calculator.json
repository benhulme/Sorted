        "Content": "<p>Time for another dog story. This time it was a dog with a deadline.<\/p>\n<p>We had moved back from overseas, but unfortunately we were forced to leave <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/blog/pet-spending-gets-wild\">Holly, our Kiwi border collie<\/a>, behind on a friend’s farm until she met the strict biosecurity requirements to come back home. She was in good hands for the moment, but how long before she would make it back?<\/p>\n<p>Eleven months later, suddenly it was all on. Our farming friends couldn’t host her much longer, and the deadline to get her over here was fast approaching – any more delays and she would have to start the vaccination process all over again. And despite all our best intentions, it became painfully obvious that a month of vet treatments, the travel and another month of quarantine over here were going to cost thousands more than the $4,500 we initially thought.<\/p>\n<p>Yet all that mattered at the time was getting the beloved dog back. That’s all we could see – we had our own form of tunnel vision. And to cover the costs that were coming in fast, we became classic ‘crisis borrowers’, taking out a personal loan that ended up costing us more than we ever intended because of high interest.<\/p>\n<h4>You’ve got tunnel vision too<\/h4>\n<p>Now, everyone gets tunnel vision at some stage. Not literally losing our peripheral vision, but rather losing perspective whenever we block out anything that might distract us from the task at hand. When we’re short on time, we prioritise and let other things slip so we can get something done. When we’re short on cash, we borrow so we can do the same. We zoom in and can’t pan out.<\/p>\n<p>Tunnelling is not necessarily a bad thing – it’s what enables us to focus and accomplish things. (I’m probably doing it right now as I write this; you may be too as you read.) And as a former reporter I can testify that a deadline can do wonders for your creativity – you can produce your best work when you’re under pressure.<\/p>\n<p>What our brains do as we tunnel, however, is to block out the rest of the world, and suddenly all we see is all there is. This is particularly dangerous when it comes to borrowing. When money is scarce, we tunnel in on how to pay the bills and that’s all we can think about.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781846143458,00.html\">Researchers have shown<\/a> that when funds are scarce and we tunnel, it leads us to borrow. We don’t think of the consequences that come with keeping up with the payments and what it will mean to have to pay it all back eventually.<\/p>\n<p>The high interest rates on credit cards, for example, can set us back for years. And tunnelling in on the minimum payment only means that we end up paying much more than we ever intended, making life tougher in the long run. That’s one of those <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/blog/dancing-around-debt-traps\">dumb debt traps<\/a> to avoid at all costs.<\/p>\n<h4>What to do?<\/h4>\n<p>Here at Sorted our solution for tunnel vision is to make sure that the total cost of credit, and the long-term impact of taking out a loan, is inside your mind’s tunnel when you are thinking about borrowing. Instead of just thinking of getting through, or about what the minimum payment will be, you need to be thinking about what going into debt will cost you overall. There’s no sense digging yourself into a deeper hole.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure to check our <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/debt\">debt calculator<\/a> to see exactly what borrowing will end up costing you in the long run, and make an informed decision about what you’re taking on.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if you are in <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/blog/pick-habit\">the habit of saving<\/a> regularly and <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/blog/cut-yourself-some-slack\">putting aside an emergency fund<\/a>, you will have options when you find yourself in a crisis. Borrowing won’t be the only thing you see when you’re in that tunnel – you’ll have options.<\/p>\n<p>Tunnelling is always going to happen; it’s how our minds work. But the more we realise what we’re doing, the more we can make sure that we’re looking at all our alternatives as we move towards reaching the light at the end.<\/p>\n<h4>She made it, finally<\/h4>\n<p>It was a happy reunion with Holly all those years ago, and she went on to live out her days here in her lovely homeland. We were even able to sell the crate she travelled in to help cover costs.<\/p>\n<p>‘Holly has had a good life with a loving family. I know she will leave many happy memories,’ our friend wrote to us after shipping her over.<\/p>\n<p>In hindsight, however, it would have been better if were able to bring her back home in a way that we weren’t still paying for years later!<\/p>",

        "Content": "<p>Readers of these posts will by now have figured out that I benefit from a particularly sophisticated, highly calibrated money management system to make my financial decisions: my wife.<\/p>\n<p>But it wasn’t always that way. Especially in the early years after the kids came along (when she had more important things to look after), I was in the driver’s seat when it came to the family finances. I wrote the cheques, paid the bills, relied on Amex gold cards to manage daily expenses… and generally made a mess of things. One of the arcane meanings of ‘husband’ is to manage prudently – let’s just say there was not always enough of that.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to interest and fees, I’ve paid more for things than I care to admit, and thanks to easily available credit, I’ve racked up more debt than I was ever comfortable with.<\/p>\n<p>Nowadays, happily, things are much less stressed. Yet it’s not just because I’ve left the bill paying to my better half, but more importantly because we’re now on the same page and gotten much more savvy about borrowing.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to the pitfalls of debt, there are generally two types of traps to avoid: paying way more for things than you ever intended to in the first place, and carrying so much debt that it drags too much on your finances. The more we dance around these, the more we get the chance to grow and actually get ahead.<\/p>\n<h4>How borrowing adds to your cost<\/h4>\n<p>I came home one day to find the television suddenly paid off. This was somewhat of a surprise – although it’s always a good feeling to pay things off – since there were many months still left on that interest-free HP agreement.<\/p>\n<p>‘It was getting too hard to figure out whether they were going to charge us interest or not,’ my wife explained.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of that television, what started as a <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/hire-purchase\">typical HP<\/a> had morphed into a <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/credit-cards\">credit card<\/a>. That is, we thought we signed up for an HP, but got mailed a credit card. And it had a ‘generous’ credit limit to go with it, of course.<\/p>\n<p>When we used the credit card for everyday expenses, intending to pay it off in full after each month (which is always a good way to avoid paying interest), it became hard to know how much was going to pay off the television and how much was going toward paying for the expenses.<\/p>\n<p>Would we make it to pay the TV off in the interest-free period? It was hard to tell. If we had gone even slightly longer, we may have been on the hook for all those months of interest we were so keen to avoid paying!<\/p>\n<p>There is always a cost to borrow, even for interest-free deals, which typically have set-up costs. So as soon as you decide to put something on credit, expect to add to the price tag, especially if you are going to pay it off over a number of months or years. Is it still a good deal?<\/p>\n<p>Sorted’s <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/debt\">debt calculator<\/a> can help you calculate the true cost for credit cards, car loans, personal loans or HP.<\/p>\n<p>So we got rid of it. The television payments, the credit card. But not the television.<\/p>\n<h4>When debt drags too much<\/h4>\n<p>Just to be clear, this is not a screed against taking out loans in general or paying for things on credit. Besides being darn convenient – you get the stuff now, you pay for it later – loans can help us move forward financially, especially when we’re borrowing for something that increases in value like a house, business or education.<\/p>\n<p>But let’s keep in mind that credit limits are <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/blog/not-your-money\">not our money<\/a>. They’re really only how much we can borrow. Can you really see yourself paying all that back? If not, you may be in danger of overextending your finances – the second debt trap! – or taking on so much debt that it becomes a burden even to make just the minimum payment each month.<\/p>\n<p>So much is sold on ‘teaser rates’ these days, which anchor our thinking to how much the payments will be each week instead of how much we’re borrowing in total. And that’s precisely what gets us into deeper waters than we planned on. Sure we can handle that minimum, but how long will it take to pay it all back? (Yet again, the <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/debt\">debt calculator<\/a> can help.)<\/p>\n<p>Overcommitting doesn’t only happen to people who find themselves in credit card trouble; it applies to all of us with mortgages, too. With all the rumblings about rates rising over the next year, will family budgets get too tight? And how much is too much when you add to your mortgage for renovations, a new car or that trip overseas?<\/p>\n<p>If you’re shopping for  a mortgage, try plugging into our <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/mortgage-repayment\">mortgage repayment calculator<\/a>and key in higher rates of 8%, for example, to see where your repayments could be in the months to come. Hopefully you’ve got some room to spare to absorb any rises that come and stay within your comfort level.<\/p>\n<p>So those are the two main types of debt traps from someone who’s had to dig himself out of a few: paying more than you ever wanted to, and carrying so much debt that it becomes too much of a burden for the budget.<\/p>\n<p>Just dance around them and get ahead!<\/p>",

I had heard of this happening more often overseas, but apparently there are close to 4,400 people who have done just that here in New Zealand, according to Inland Revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully the biggest group (149,000 or so) have borrowed in the $5,000 to $10,000 range, which feels much more manageable. Because while a student loan may feel at first as if we’re being paid to be a student, it’s all money that, of course, has to be eventually paid back.<\/p>\n<p>Here at Sorted we think student loans are ‘smart debt’ – as opposed to the dumb kind where you pay high interest and fees for months and even years for items you didn’t really need in the first place. With your student loan, think of it as investing in an asset that will become more and more valuable over time: you and your career.<\/p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #d3d3d3; padding: 20px;\">\n<h2 class=\"first\">Top tips to keep costs down as a student<\/h2>\n<ol><li>Ask for student discounts.<\/li>\n<li>Buy second-hand books and clothes.<\/li>\n<li>Go out on student nights.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid takeaways – cook your own food!<\/li>\n<\/ol><\/div>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>Since your student loan is interest free (unless you head abroad), there’s less of a rush to pay it back. This year, however, the government did move to require former students to pay back their loans at a faster clip, with 12% instead of 10% being deducted from your wages when you start working and earning over <a href=\"http://www.studylink.govt.nz/student-loan/your-obligations/index.html\">a certain threshold<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Any debt to repay, whether interest-free or not, is a drag on the finances. The question is: how much do you need to borrow these days for a degree? And how can you be sure it’s worth it?<\/p>\n<h4>What will it take?<\/h4>\n<p>Setting aside living expenses for the moment, let’s look at the main university costs to be covered each year.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Typical course fees: $5,000–$7,000<\/li>\n<li>Textbooks: $500–$1,000<\/li>\n<li>Student services levy or fee: $540–$726<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Which means that, if we’re looking at how much different degrees cost, here’s what it will take to graduate. It’s a fair bit.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Bachelors: $21,500<\/li>\n<li>Masters: $15,000<\/li>\n<li>Doctorates: $22,500  <\/li>\n<\/ul><h4>How long to pay it all back?<\/h4>\n<p>In 2012, most eligible students were taking advantage of the student loan scheme (73%), many for the first time (27%). The average amount they were borrowing was $7,800. Of course, that was only for 2012 – over the years the loan amounts certainly add up. At 30 June 2013, the average loan at Inland Revenue was just above $19,000.<\/p>\n<p>Just a bit more than half of repayments (57%) were collected through the PAYE tax system in the 2012–13 tax year, and the rest directly from borrowers looking to pay back their loans early.<\/p>\n<p>But how long does it generally take us to pay them back? For those who finished their studies back in 2009, for example, Statistics New Zealand estimates that those who are based here in New Zealand will take 6.7 years on average to pay back their loans. For those who are not always based in country, it will on average take significantly longer: 12.1 years.<\/p>\n<h4>Where does it all lead?               <\/h4>\n<p>Another way to look at this is to look at what you might earn in the years following study. Let’s say you finished studying in 2011, when the median salary nationally was $34,200. Here are some Ministry of Education median salary estimates for two years and five years afterwards. Those degrees make a difference.<\/p>\n<table class=\"data\" style=\"width: 401px; height: 85px;\" cellspacing=\"50\" cellpadding=\"50\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Study completed in 2011<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>After 2 years<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>After 5 years<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr><tr><td>Diploma<\/td>\n<td>$32,025<\/td>\n<td>$39,046<\/td>\n<\/tr><tr><td>Bachelor's degree<\/td>\n<td>$43,720<\/td>\n<td>$50,749<\/td>\n<\/tr><tr><td>Master's degree<\/td>\n<td>$50,880<\/td>\n<td>$59,341<\/td>\n<\/tr><tr><td>Doctorate<\/td>\n<td>$66,672<\/td>\n<td>$71,412<\/td>\n<\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><p> <\/p>\n<p><span>What field of study you choose, and whether your career is highly sought after in today’s world, is also important. Have a look at <\/span><em><a href=\"http://http//www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/employment-skills/labour-market-reports/occupation-outlook\" target=\"_blank\">Occupation Outlook<\/a>, <\/em><span>which has just been put out by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Along with the <\/span><a href=\"http://www.careers.govt.nz/\">Careers New Zealand website<\/a><span>, the report is one of the first places you can look when you consider possible career options. It shows what your chances are of getting a job once you have finished studying, with dashboard dials that show potential income, fees, and future job prospects for 50 key occupations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So for example, while things are not so rosy for actors (low income, low fees, low prospects), they are decidedly better for software developers (high income, low fees, high prospects). There are even growth forecasts for some careers through to 2021.<\/p>\n<p>It’s good to know what you’re borrowing for, and whether you’ll be able to use your studies to launch your career. Think of it as an investment in yourself.<\/p>",

It looks to be a well-executed balance of duty and fun. (The weather’s been less than cooperative, but they probably planned for that, too.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now I can only guess the amount of work that has gone into preparing the way for each stop along Kate and William’s route: from racing each other on America’s Cup yachts in Auckland to jetting the Shotover rapids in Queenstown. All the details that need to be worked out for each event, the protocols, the security, the costs – it’s a triumph of logistics and planning.<\/p>\n<p>If there’s anything that can drive up costs unexpectedly and see them spiral out of control, its overseas travel. Just think of your own journeys abroad. We all could use a royal planning team for those big trips, with so many variables at play.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, travelling with kids, which the Cambridges are handling for the first time, brings its own set of challenges.<\/p>\n<h4>Out comes the card<\/h4>\n<p>For our own travels, without having a team of planners at our beck and call, there is that all-too-easy alternative to planning ahead: simply whack it on the credit card and deal with it when we get back. That’s what they’re made for right? Play now, pay later.<\/p>\n<p>And pay we do – in interest. Which, if we don’t pay off our balance right away, can stretch out the time and cost of the trip for years. Check out our <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/debt#tab-credit-card\">debt calculator<\/a> to figure out the true cost of putting that trip on credit and how long it will take to pay it back.<\/p>\n<p>Travelling overseas on plastic means you are borrowing money for something that – other than the invaluable experiences that come with seeing the world – will have no monetary value afterwards. Put another way: after the trip, there’s not much to show for it.<\/p>\n<h4>We spend much more … for much longer<\/h4>\n<p>Credit cards make it easy for us to spend much more. One factor is the way that many individual purchases are bound together into a single balance at the end of the month – making it more difficult to keep track of your decisions as you go.<\/p>\n<p>If you were paying with cash, your mind would immediately weigh up whether the pain of parting with your money is worth the pleasure of whatever you’re buying. Paying with a credit card, that pain vs pleasure trade-off doesn’t happen – they’re separated in time by a month.<\/p>\n<p>Pleasure now, pain when the bill comes in. Separate those two, and you only feel pleasure as you’re spending overseas – leaving the harsh reality to hit when you return home.<\/p>\n<h4>Save ahead, try debit<\/h4>\n<p>The alternative to relying on credit, of course, is to save ahead. One way of using Sorted’s Saving Calculator is to plan holidays – it lets you make a list of costs (airfares, accommodation, food, etc) and then tracks your savings so you can make sure you’re putting enough aside before you go.<\/p>\n<p>You may not have a financial forecasting team or staff like the Royals do, but you do have the team and technology here at Sorted.<\/p>\n<p>I’m a big fan of using debit cards for trips, as they are linked directly to bank accounts. That way I’m using my own money as I go, with no debt or interest to pay when I’m back home. There are other options that use ‘real’ money too, such as prepaid travel cards.<\/p>\n<p>Staying at a hotel last year, however, I discovered one drawback to debit cards. Instead of simply handing over a credit card when I checked in at the desk as security in case I damaged anything, with a debit card, they needed to take out $300 from my account and replace it when I checked out – which was somewhat disconcerting at first. Luckily, I had funds on hand for these sorts of things – which is what often happens with travelling, doesn’t it? In the end it worked out just fine.<\/p>\n<h4>A royal discount<\/h4>\n<p>One of the things that has been reported about the Royal tour is that the Duke and Duchess will be staying at a Queenstown lodge that normally would cost $12,000 a night. Nothing strange in that, for such celebrities as they are.<\/p>\n<p>But here’s the thing: apparently they will be staying there at a discounted rate more like the cost of a local hotel – hundreds of dollars instead of thousands.<\/p>\n<p>Like all that savvy travel planning, that’s a discount worth aspiring to.<\/p>",

She smiled.<\/p>\n<p>Setting aside the deep, serious questions of the afterlife and whatnot, it seems to me that there are tiny deaths and resurrections happening around us all the time. And each time something ends, it’s another opportunity for something better to begin.<\/p>\n<p>Like starting a new job, after a dreary one where you’re losing the will to live. Or fixing something that’s been broken and giving it a new lease of life.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to money, a less-than-savvy debt decision can be the last straw that jars us out of old habits and gets us back on track towards <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/net-worth\">growing net worth<\/a> instead of slipping backwards. So if you’re hurting financially, look at it as your chance for a comeback.<\/p>\n<p>Recently I got in touch with someone in our Sorted community to find out more about how he resurrected his finances. I’ll let him tell you the story:<\/p>\n<p>‘About eight years ago I was in deep credit card debt of about $18,000 over three cards. I  paid for a motorcycle at an auction with one card.<\/p>\n<p>‘I knew that I was getting nowhere in paying off the balance, as it was so large. I started reading everything I could about personal finance and self-improvement. I can’t remember when the Sorted site first started, but I began using the calculators and suggestions on money management when I first found the site.<\/p>\n<p>‘I worked long hours to earn enough money to start reducing the credit card debt. I also started to spend less on things that I didn't need, but I would treat myself when I had achieved a good reduction in debt…<\/p>\n<p>‘I made a point of joining KiwiSaver and started contributing to this while I was reducing the card debt, as this gave me a sense of getting somewhere financially.<\/p>\n<p>‘I also combined all my card debt and transferred this to a low-rate card, including having a very low rate for six months as part of the transfer from the other bank. I made a point of destroying  the cards that I no longer used – as a type of cleansing ritual.<\/p>\n<p>‘I still have a low rate card, but I only use it for small items and I pay it off before the due date. I have paid off all of the original card debt and have a reasonable amount in KiwiSaver now.<\/p>\n<p>‘I even have some cash in the bank.’<\/p>\n<p>Now there’s a true turnaround – a real rebirth.<\/p>",

        "Content": "<p>Just the other day I came across a taxi driver who, without knowing what I do for a living, proceeded to tell me how he was juggling his repayments on his house and his taxi.<\/p>\n<p>He was literally juggling – he could not make the minimum on both the house and car at the same time and was switching between them. He made a few payments to the taxi company, then the bank, struggling to recover. Unfortunately, his situation had already slid into a big mess. Not knowing all the details, I really hope it is not past the point of no return for him and his family. (Apparently his wife had just taken over the money management. Good move.)<\/p>\n<p>Missing a loan repayment is a much bigger deal than it seems. How do I know this? I’ve been there. Some years ago, after going through <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/life-events/redundancy\">redundancy<\/a> at work,  I watched as a credit card balance spiralled out of control. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.<\/p>\n<p>And when I say spiralled, I mean it spiralled <em>up<\/em> – from a just-about manageable $6,000 balance to north of $9,650 in seemingly no time.<\/p>\n<p>Hold on, you might say, aren’t loan balances supposed to always go <em>down <\/em>as you pay them back, not up? How is that even possible?<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is a very real scenario if you miss any repayments.  It’s a seemingly small thing that can eventually wreak havoc on your finances and cause long-term damage.<\/p>\n<h4>Statement shock<\/h4>\n<p>These days I’ve been poring over balance statements gone horribly wrong – anonymous examples of people who have got into trouble with their <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/car-loans\">car loans<\/a>, <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/personal-loans\">personal loans<\/a> or <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/hire-purchase\">hire purchase<\/a> agreements.<\/p>\n<p>It all starts out well. The credit experience begins with getting the new stuff, the loan granted and the repayments being made on time. No worries.<\/p>\n<p>But then something unexpected happens. It always does. And without <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/blog/cut-yourself-some-slack\">an emergency fund<\/a>to fall back on, a payment gets missed.<\/p>\n<p>And that’s when the fees kick in. Default fees, default <a id=\"lexicon-term-interest\" class=\"lexicon-term label glossary-tip-opener tip-opener glossarytip-label glossary-tip-focus tip-focus\" href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/glossary#Interest\">interest<\/a> charges, even $25 charges for each letter sent and phone call made just to let you know you are running behind. Loans can slide backwards even as much as $100 a week.<\/p>\n<p>Now most of us, being eternal optimists, think we’ll just recover the next time we get paid. And we might. But the many fees out there make this more and more difficult. Over time, without help, they can bury you.  And you may end up wondering why, after months of making extra payments, you are not making so much as a dent in your loan.<\/p>\n<h4>When loans go backwards<\/h4>\n<p>Here’s one horror story I looked at: a car loan gone tragically wrong. The Holden Commodore cost $30,000 in May 2011, which must have sounded like a normal price to the buyer at the time. The repayments were high, though: $467 a fortnight.<\/p>\n<p>When we’re buying, those are the only two figures we think about – the overall price and the minimum payment. Can we make that? Yet we tend to overestimate how much we can take on in the short term.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there were some more numbers that got loaded on right away:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Establishment fee: $1,500<\/li>\n<li>Broker fee: $1,500<\/li>\n<li>And unbelievably, repayment insurance for the lender: $4,495<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Now these were unusually high and should have been questioned. Even before the borrower made a single repayment, that loan balance swelled to $37,495!<\/p>\n<p>Things started out okay for the first few months, with the borrower making those $467 payments as agreed. Then the trouble started, and when they were due to make the sixth payment, they were only able to pay $200. And the penalties hit:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Default fee: $10 per week<\/li>\n<li>Default interest: 5% on top of the 19.95%<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Despite the borrower following up with a payment of $667 to recover, the balance quickly grew to $37,808 anyway because of the fees and interest. Shocking, isn’t it?<\/p>\n<h4>Don’t hesitate to get help<\/h4>\n<p>Now in hindsight, the moment to get help is immediately <em>before<\/em> having to miss a payment. Many lenders will help by adjusting a loan so you can get things back on track. And budget advisers are available to help negotiate on your behalf. But for most of us, if we are left to our own devices, things will rapidly go from bad to worse.<\/p>\n<p>For 19 months, our car buyer kept making payments on this loan, getting nowhere fast. Even though they made a few payments of as much as $600, they never caught up and were always in arrears. Exasperated, they could not understand why they had poured $14,270 into the loan without any result. There were probably more dents in that car than in the loan!<\/p>\n<p>The balance grew as high as $37,579, and the car was almost repossessed.<\/p>\n<p>In other cases it gets worse.<\/p>\n<p>Had the car been repossessed, it would have no longer been worth it’s original price of $30,000. Most cars depreciate horribly. Let’s say it was worth just $12,000.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the amount still owed would have been that $37,579 – so guess who would have been left holding the remaining $25,579?<\/p>\n<p>Yep, the car buyer – with only the loan to show for it.<\/p>\n<p>How do you recover from something like that?<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"first\"><strong>Get help right away<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Someone you know or you yourself may be coping with debt that’s got out of control. If you or they are about to miss a repayment or have already done so, don’t hesitate: call a budget adviser at <strong>0508 BUDGET<\/strong>.<\/p>",

        "Content": "<p>‘I have everything I need.’<\/p>\n<p>That’s quite a statement. Could you say the same? When a friend told me that some years ago, I was somewhat taken aback – how could he say that? (I obviously didn’t feel the same way at the time.) He was in a pretty thankful place.<\/p>\n<p>Now <a href=\"https://static.squarespace.com/static/52853b8ae4b0a6c35d3f8e9d/t/531f8140e4b03eb27337b156/1394573632883/gratitude-a-tool-for-reducing-economic-impatience.pdf\">a new study<\/a> shows that if we get into an attitude of thankfulness, it could make a big difference in the way we manage our money. A bit of gratitude, apparently, may go a long way in helping us avoid impatient financial decisions, impulse buys or borrowing in a crisis.<\/p>\n<p>It sort of makes sense. By being grateful for what we have now and giving thanks for all that there is, we focus less on what’s lacking and more on what we actually have. And we’re less prone to hit the ‘Buy now’ button if we don’t need to.<\/p>\n<h4>No need to hide this emotion<\/h4>\n<p>Since so much about the way we handle money is about our emotions and not just figures and percentages, the way we think and relate to money really matters.<\/p>\n<p>But usually we think that we need to play down our emotions to avoid making money mistakes. For example, we feel a bit low so we go in for some retail therapy and pay too much or splurge on things we later regret. In the past the solution has been to try to ignore our underlying feelings – keep it all under control with a bit of willpower.<\/p>\n<p>This time it’s different: researchers have identified an emotion that actually helps and should instead be played up. No need to keep a lid on it. The more we reflect and appreciate things, the more patient we become and the better choices we make.<\/p>\n<h4>Looking long term<\/h4>\n<p>Yet we’re an impatient lot. People tend to value smaller instant rewards and discount those larger ones that are far off in the future – and we all make costly, short-sighted mistakes because of it.<\/p>\n<p>But putting off a purchase or putting money aside for the future is too much like giving money away, right? The problem is, giving it to a future version of yourself seems too much like you’re giving it away to someone you don’t know. Why would you?<\/p>\n<p>Yet if we can delay our need for instant gratification, and increase our patience, we can make better decisions and get better results. (No wonder patience has been called a virtue for centuries.)<\/p>\n<h4>What are you thankful for?<\/h4>\n<p>So apparently, even when real money’s at stake, gratitude reduces excessive impatience and helps avoid costly mistakes. Not just general happiness, but gratitude in particular.<\/p>\n<p>So what do you feel gratitude about – right now?<\/p>\n<p>An attitude of appreciation is what’s called for. Someone I’ve found inspiring in this regard was the exceptional Chiara Lubich, who said that she hoped to reach the end of her life being all gratitude – ‘for everything, and for always’.<\/p>\n<p>Not sure that I’ll get that far, but hey, I’m just grateful for the chance.<\/p>",

        "Content": "<p>‘Shreem brezee… Shreem brezee…’ One morning during the Christmas break, I woke to the sound of a recorded mantra being chanted on YouTube in the kitchen. This was somewhat unusual.<\/p>\n<p>It was not entirely surprising though: my better half had been learning about and dabbling with all sorts of mantras in the weeks prior. A ‘kleem’ here, a ‘shreem’ there… However, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-apKBclf4g\">the ‘shreem brezee’ one<\/a> had images to go with the chants: coins, notes, even gold bullion. Apparently, it’s a mantra aimed at attracting prosperity and wealth.<\/p>\n<p>Now I suppose we could all join together in a group mantra-chanting session to manifest an abundant 2014, but of course that’s a bit beyond our remit here at Sorted. What we are after this year is sharp decision making. And with the economy improving and confidence soaring, it’s time to take advantage and make choices that move us all forward financially.<\/p>\n<p>‘Shrink dumb debt… Shrink dumb debt…’ Well, perhaps 108 repetitions of that would be a tad overkill.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, in the next few months, among other things, we’ll be focusing on two positive ways to get ahead: savvy borrowing and making the most of KiwiSaver.<\/p>\n<h4>Savvy borrowing<\/h4>\n<p>A family friend who is a game designer in Las Vegas takes a more positive view of credit cards than most. To him they are not just about convenience. I discovered that this was because years ago he used a card to borrow enough for one of his first computers, paving the way for his successful programming career.<\/p>\n<p>It’s no wonder he sees things differently, since he was borrowing for an asset that would increase in value in the years that followed. But the asset was not just the computer itself – he was investing in his skills, and he was able to extend them further as a result.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, in hindsight, his was savvy borrowing. There will be lots of other examples of ways that we can borrow for assets such as education or a property that will increase in value as time goes by.<\/p>\n<p>Another way of borrowing wisely is avoiding the dumb debt traps out there – those purchases that leave you with high-interest bills to pay that could have been avoided in the first place. Have a look at the <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/shrink\">debt slider on our Shrink page<\/a> to see what you might be getting into.<\/p>\n<h4>Making the most of KiwiSaver<\/h4>\n<p>January is a great time of year to get finances on track and check in with your KiwiSaver situation. We’ve got the best tool for just that: the <a href=\"http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/?utm_source=sorted.org.nz&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=internal-promotion\">KiwiSaver fund finder<\/a>, where you’ll be able to check your current fund and see how it stacks up against the many others out there. Are you in the right one for you?<\/p>\n<p>Because of the incentives that come with <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/kiwisaver\">KiwiSaver<\/a>, the scheme is one of the main ways people like you and me are managing to get ahead. After all, it’s not just your savings – there are contributions from the government in the form of the tax credit, from your employer if you are an employee, as well as the market returns from the money being invested.<\/p>\n<h4>What getting ahead is really all about<\/h4>\n<p>‘Getting ahead’ really means <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/net-worth\">growing net worth<\/a>. Many of us may be hundreds of thousands in debt with a mortgage and have a negative net worth, but what counts is to be heading towards the positive – that’s getting ahead. Have a look at our <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/net-worth\">net worth calculator<\/a> and work out not just where you are at today, but where you will be in the years to come. Will your net worth have grown by the end of the year? That’s the goal.<\/p>\n<p>When you see how your decisions affect your net worth, you’ll find more ways to grow.<\/p>\n<p>Here’s to an abundant 2014. I’ll leave you with a funny fact about that ‘Shreem brezee’ mantra morning, though: that very day, because of an early holiday payday and surprise Christmas gifts, more money came in to our household than on any other day all year.<\/p>\n<p>Go figure. <\/p>",

        "Content": "<p>You may find yourself – as I have a few times – tracking every cent you spend, trying to rein in expenses and find a way out of one hole or another.<\/p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/money-tracking\">money tracking<\/a> is important, it only goes so far. It’s definitely valuable to see where your money is going, and to check that things are tracking to plan. However, trimming off a coffee, bagging a lunch or clipping coupons generally won’t be enough to turn anyone’s finances around.<\/p>\n<p>When we find ourselves with a magnifying glass, looking to shave off expenses here and there or squirrel something away, we may be missing the big picture. It’s time to take hold of the movie camera and pan out. In that spirit, here are some of the big decisions and habits that can really make a difference to your <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/net-worth\">net worth<\/a> throughout life:<\/p>\n<h4>Borrow only what you need<\/h4>\n<p>People tend to borrow as much as they possibly can, not just what they need. You can see this future-defeating pattern everywhere, whether it’s for personal loans, car loans, credit cards and of course mortgages.<\/p>\n<p>How much to borrow is an especially important decision when it comes to student loans, which, despite being interest free (if you stay in country), will still take many years of working to pay back.<\/p>\n<p>A credit limit is not really your money, it’s<a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/news/posts/not-your-money\"> just how much you can borrow<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Clear the cards each month<\/h4>\n<p>We also tend to underestimate the true cost of something paid for on credit. It’s no small task to get this right because of the interest and fees charged (although our <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/debt\">debt calculator<\/a> can help).<\/p>\n<p>To avoid interest costs as we use those convenient cards, the way to go is to simply pay off the entire balance at the end of each month. It’s a great habit to get into.<\/p>\n<p>Making just the minimum payment may make us feel like we’re not in debt, but of course we certainly are. If you find yourself consistently spending more than you intended, you can always switch to using ‘real money’ with a debit card or cold cash even.<\/p>\n<h4>Join KiwiSaver<\/h4>\n<p>Although not for absolutely everyone, these days you need a really good reason not to be in <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/kiwisaver\">KiwiSaver<\/a>. It’s become a really important part of the way Kiwis prepare for retirement.<\/p>\n<p>What tips the balance so much in its favour are the contributions from the government and employers, which help boost our own individual savings. You can <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/news/posts/jump-housing-hurdle\">use KiwiSaver for a first home deposit<\/a>, too.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, anyone not in KiwiSaver is leaving free money on the table. Check out the new<a href=\"http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/?utm_source=sorted.org.nz&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=internal-promotion\">KiwiSaver fund finder<\/a> for help comparing all the funds out there.<\/p>\n<h4>Choose wisely where you live, what you drive<\/h4>\n<p>It certainly doesn’t take very long to finance a car, and signing a mortgage doesn’t take that long either. These choices, however, have long-term effects on our finances. Because we tend to borrow as much as we can – and lenders can be quite ‘generous’ with their offers – it’s not hard to wind up with an overextended budget that’s stressed.<\/p>\n<p>While at home we’ve been able to reduce our housing expenses hugely for the moment, recently we’ve been marvelling at how much we end up spending on transportation each month. Housing and transportation take the biggest bite out of budgets, and choosing not to stretch too far could mean that you have thousands freed up to instead to spend on the things that make you happy.<\/p>\n<h4>Buy a house – with as big a deposit as possible, and aim to pay it off fast<\/h4>\n<p>I used to think that buying a house was just that, wondering if it was worth all the expense and the hassle. These days I’ve discovered that it’s much more than just owning the roof over our heads; it’s a decision that can make a huge difference to our financial position and our situation <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/news/posts/mind-gap\">when we retire<\/a>. Admittedly, it’s gotten harder to do this though.<\/p>\n<p>The larger the deposit the better. Even though this means that it becomes all that harder to save one, it also means that tens of thousands can be saved on interest. Paying it off faster than the full term is another choice that also avoids a lot of mortgage interest. Sorted’s <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/mortgage-repayment\">mortgage repayment calculator<\/a> and <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/mortgage-manager\">mortgage manager<\/a> can show you how much.<\/p>\n<h4>Keep investing in yourself<\/h4>\n<p>Here at Sorted we often look at investing and how to make your money work for you. Usually it’s investment in assets like shares, property or bonds that can increase in value. Yet there is another sort of capital we can grow as well – human capital – by investing in ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>We can do this by investing money in our continuing education, our career, our networks. For the entrepreneurs and the self-employed out there, this might mean your own business, or it might mean increasing your business savvy.<\/p>\n<p>So the choices we make in any of the above categories can have a much greater impact on our finances than just counting everyday costs. This is big-picture thinking; what you see when you pan out a bit. Have a look at our <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/net-worth\">net worth calculator<\/a> to see which choices will matter most in the long run.<\/p>",

Many of us are hitched to our own debt wagon, dragging it along with no end in sight. But how do you make the leap forward from living on your credit card, your overdraft or your revolving mortgage to being debt-free? It’s certainly not the simplest transition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It’s an entire change of lifestyle.<\/p>\n<h4>Living in overdraft<\/h4>\n<p>In one of our seminars last year, a Dunedin student shared her goal to get out of overdraft for good. It was a hole she couldn’t seem to get out of each month – she never seemed to have enough to climb out entirely.<\/p>\n<p>Staying in overdraft each month was probably costing her between 12–19% interest for every dollar she used that was not her own. But how to make the switch?<\/p>\n<h4>Exiting the revolving mortgage<\/h4>\n<p>Even those with a much higher net worth are hooked on revolving mortgages – relatively cheap money that allows them to easily borrow against their house for a trip here, a new car here. But does that arrangement make it that much easier to spend more than they intend? And how much does it all cost over time?<\/p>\n<p>That mortgage balance still needs to be paid eventually, especially to be freehold by retirement, which is certainly something to aspire to. What goes up…<\/p>\n<h4>Living by the card<\/h4>\n<p>For years all my expenses landed on my gold card. Like all credit cards, it certainly made it so easy to spend more than I planned. (If I planned at all, that is. What I definitely planned on doing is somehow covering the balance at the end of the month – if I could. When I couldn’t, things got expensive.)<\/p>\n<p>With credit cards, people spend 30% more than they would if they used cash, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=5959413&amp;page=1\">according to Dr Ted Klontz<\/a>, author and expert on financial psychology. And it’s so easy to treat our credit limit as if <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/news/posts/not-your-money\">it were our own money<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Happily, I stick to ‘real money’ for my spending these days, but it sure took long enough to ditch the debt wagon.<\/p>\n<h4>Missing that monthly ticket<\/h4>\n<p>A few months ago I stopped in at my local petrol station to buy my monthly train ticket. In my case, the monthly ticket is close to $100 cheaper than if you bought a 10-trip ticket each week.<\/p>\n<p>Now it turns out the lady at the till is somewhat of a personal finance guru herself. (For all I know, she may own a part of the station.) She told me how she had urged another customer to go for the monthly ticket to save that $100. He was stuck on the 10-trips and never had enough money to buy the more expensive – but in the end cheaper – monthly ticket. He was living from pay to pay.<\/p>\n<p>She told him what he needed to do: put aside $20 a week until he had enough to afford the ticket. She even offered to hold the money for him! No luck.<\/p>\n<h4>How to leave the wagon behind<\/h4>\n<p>All this borrowing means we’re living in the past, paying back other peoples’ money for past expenses. And the debt is a drag on real wealth that we might be building for the future.<\/p>\n<p>My petrol-pumping guru’s advice to that 10-tripper is actually the key to ditching the debt wagon. Following her advice, putting aside a savings cushion, gives you the option of no longer borrowing to get by. That’s a great option to have.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you have to start small, say just 1% of your income, you can slowly build a fund to tap into and have an alternative to borrowing. By paying yourself first after each pay into a separate savings account – if you can, make it an automatic payment – you can help your finances leap forward instead of always paying back the past.<\/p>\n<p>Admittedly, turning your finances around like this takes time and patience. But remember this is an entire lifestyle change – for the better.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"first\">Not all debt's dumb<\/h2>\n<p>Of course, Sorted is not necessarily out to erase all forms of debt – consumer credit can certainly be used to your advantage. Smart debt for things that increase in value like education, property or a business can get you moving forward in the right direction. Dumb debt, on the other hand, should be avoided like the plague. Yet for any debt there is a cost, and you can always bring up our <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/debt\">debt calculator<\/a> to figure out how much more you are paying when you borrow.<\/p>",

        "Content": "<p>The discovery that I had ‘received’ an increase in my credit card limit was a happy one at first. I now had $2,500 ‘to work with’.<\/p>\n<p>Or perhaps I should say ‘to play with’, since shortly after I went online and ordered that new guitar with the paua shell inlay that I had been eyeing for months. Sure, I’d pay it off over time, I thought, whenever more money started coming in and I was in a better spot financially.<\/p>\n<p>Your credit limit may have also reached new heights, thanks to your friendly lending institution. You too have more to ‘work with’, more to ‘play with’. You suddenly have options.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe too many options. A credit increase is not a pay increase, and there are some serious strings that come attached to those funds. The interest and fees that can come with a line of credit can add to your balance very quickly, and that balance has a way of creeping its way upward. Before you know it your statement shows what was once a debt molehill has become a true mountain.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is: the money’s not really yours. It belongs to an immense faceless international conglomerate somewhere, and you are actually just borrowing it to use. (Funny how that ‘available credit’ number can appear mighty similar to a bank account balance, though.) The more you remember it as money you’re borrowing, the more you will be able to manage your credit card wisely and avoid the dead weight of debt.<\/p>\n<p>Just because it’s available to you doesn’t mean you should. A key question to ask is, can you really see yourself borrowing that much? Can you see yourself paying it back?<\/p>\n<p>And if you did, how much would it end up costing you? The Aussies and North Americans have introduced credit card statements that show what happens when you only pay the minimum each month and how much longer it will take to pay off. Since these are a ways off here in New Zealand, unfortunately, Sorted’s <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/debt\">debt calculator<\/a> is the right tool to figure out how much interest you will pay on your debt and how much you can save by paying it off earlier.<\/p>\n<p>Bank overdrafts work in a similar way to credit cards, although because these are more closely linked to your everyday bank balance, they may be an even easier debt hole to fall into. And the interest that you pay on them each month makes it that much more difficult to climb out.<\/p>\n<p>Mortgages and revolving mortgages are no different. At one point one of my colleagues, after riding up the boom in housing prices, was told by a mortgage broker that she would be able to borrow enough to finance a house worth a cool million. She was cool to the idea and wisely walked away, thinking them crazy to lend her that much. And perhaps they were. Or perhaps they didn’t care that much at the time.<\/p>\n<p>Then there are those purchases we make on finance (what used to be called hire purchase), which these days cleverly morph into credit cards. (Are there any real HPs left?) You might pay off that flat screen within the interest-free period and think you’re done doing business with the finance company, only to find that you’ve ended up with a credit card you never wanted in the first place. Unless you manage it carefully, you may end up using it just because it’s there.<\/p>\n<p>Having more credit available to us is one of the things that can lead to ‘lifestyle inflation’ – when you gradually get used to more expensive things that you didn’t need before and really don’t need now but somehow can’t live without. Little by little whatever <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/money-planner\">money plan<\/a> you had gets washed away by these small increases in expenses and the higher interest rates you’re paying on your debt.<\/p>\n<p>If you’re like me, you may find yourself asking, ‘Where did it all go?’<\/p>\n<p>At least I know where that paua-shell guitar went – I sold it to a friend overseas. It took me years to pay off, and I’m still in enough denial that I actively avoid calculating how much that guitar actually cost me. (I’m sure it was far more than I sold it for.)<\/p>\n<p>I’d rather not know.<\/p>",

I was getting in a bit of gardening when my wife rolled up the drive, smiling with a new 46’ flat-screen TV in the back of our wagon.<\/p>\n<p>Since I didn’t see this one coming, my first reaction was somewhat mixed. I confess there was a bit of dread inside, especially since I prefer <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/news/posts/working-web-save\">comparing prices online<\/a> before a big purchase. Did she get a good deal? Had she been charmed by the salesman and ripped off?  Did she borrow or pay cash? (Turned out to be <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/hire-purchase\">hire purchase<\/a> that morphed into a<a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/credit-cards\">credit card<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>I quickly set aside all that inner conflict and went with it – complimenting her excellent timing and looking forward to the All Blacks playing Argentina. (Being a visual artist, she also has a knack for picking out the best screens.)<\/p>\n<p>Some friends of ours are a husband-and-wife team of marriage therapists, and for relationships to thrive, they say, what’s needed is both autonomy and communication. By autonomy they mean avoiding co-dependency and being able to act freely within the relationship and take the initiative. At the same time, communication means putting in all the time and effort that it takes to express and explore our frequently opposite takes on things to grow together.<\/p>\n<p>Lose the autonomy in a relationship and we all feel smothered. Lose the communication and we drift apart.<\/p>\n<p>Now for finances to thrive in a relationship, we need much of the same: autonomy plus communication. I think it’s fair to say that, no matter how combined a couple’s finances are, these days asking a partner for ‘permission’ to purchase something is hopefully a thing of the past. Yet that makes it all the more important to communicate and coordinate the choices we make and the goals we’re working toward together.<\/p>\n<p>The first step to getting sorted financially begins with <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/setting-goals\">setting goals<\/a>, and it makes sense to set them together. Sorted’s <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/goals-worksheet\">goals worksheet<\/a> can help you put down your goals for the short (6 months to a year), medium (1–5 years) and long terms (5 years plus).<\/p>\n<p>To get Mars and Venus aligned on money matters, it helps to know what finance experts call your ‘money personality’ – our <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/money-personality\">money personality profiler<\/a>  is a useful tool to know yourself and your partner better. It will help you find your financial strengths and may uncover some blind spots, too.<\/p>\n<p>Once your goals are in place, Sorted’s <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/money-planner\">money planner<\/a> is the ideal calculator to get your money going exactly where you want it to, by first tracking all your incomings and outgoings and figuring out if you have a surplus or deficit. Any surplus you make can then go toward those goals.<\/p>\n<p>Since I felt that our autonomy tank had been running a bit low in our relationship, I celebrated my wife’s flat screen purchase, but at the same time vowed to communicate more often and more openly about managing that debt.<\/p>\n<p>So far it’s been going quite well – we’re still in the interest-free period, so we can be movie buffs at home without racking up any interest charges. We’ve been discussing the monthly statements and making sure we are on track to pay it off on time.<\/p>\n<p>(I’ve been hearing horror stories about leaving HP unpaid beyond the interest-free period – some finance companies may charge you interest even for the entire interest-free period if you run the slightest bit over.)<\/p>\n<p>So it feels like we are on the way to relationship – and financial – happiness. But come to think of it, I never really told her much about that ‘dread’ I mentioned above, so I could probably work on communicating better…<\/p>\n<p>It’s a work in progress.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>",

        "Content": "<p>Marty was obviously delighted. The 12-year-old Down syndrome boy was all smiles on the Lullaby, a five-metre-long gliding platform at a Taupo playground. As my own kids played and did their thing, I spent the better part of a half-hour with Marty on that shared swing.<\/p>\n<p>We were standing at each end, swinging, pushing the Lullaby higher, mimicking each other’s movements. At one point we lay back and tipped our heads backward over the ends, looking up at the clearing clouds on that perfect autumn day. He was unable to say much more than laugh, smile or give a thumbs up – yet that was everything.<\/p>\n<p>All of which got me thinking, since this week I am looking at an important, simple measure of our personal finances: net worth. It’s basically the number you are left with when you take what you own and subtract what you owe. It’s the amount you would have in hand if today you sold everything you had and paid off all your debt. (Have a look at yours using our <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/net-worth\">net worth calculator<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<h4>What you’re worth (really)<\/h4>\n<p>Try as we might to separate the two, <em>net worth<\/em> often seems to get tangled up with <em>self-worth<\/em>. They are not the same – what you are worth in dollars does not equal what you are worth as a person. Don’t let anyone convince you otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>Now someone like Marty, for instance, may never have a high net worth to speak of, at least without a lot of help from family and friends. He may never build much monetary wealth. Yet his worth as a person, however, is undeniable (I consider him a true teacher).<\/p>\n<p>Of course those who make the rich list and other high-net-worth individuals may hold up their number as measure of who they are and what they’ve accomplished. But high-income earners can just as easily have a low net worth if they squander everything they have on liabilities (things that take money out of your pocket).<\/p>\n<p>The thing is, many middle-income earners, especially while paying off debt or just starting on a mortgage, can find themselves with a negative or low net worth for decades.<\/p>\n<p>It’s a challenge not to get negative about ourselves.<\/p>\n<h4>Get your number growing<\/h4>\n<p>So let’s clear this up once and for all: your actual number is far less important than the direction it’s heading. It’s growing your net worth that counts. Remember, the goal is to increase and protect your net worth over time.<\/p>\n<p>Net worth is a focused snapshot of where you are today. It also allows you to easily see what a drag debt is, especially dumb debt. For example, racking up $2,000 of credit card debt means your net worth decreases by $2,000. The opposite is also true: every dollar you use toward paying off debt increases your net worth. The same goes for smarter debt like student loans. If you are paying off a mortgage, those dollars are gradually building your net worth and your equity (when they are not going towards the interest).<\/p>\n<p>As you look at your financial picture, think about what it will look like in the future. One of my favourite things about the <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/net-worth\">net worth calculator<\/a> is a tiny tick box marked ‘Plan for future years’. Ticking that box lets you figure out what financial shape you’ll be in, in 5 years and 15 years. And if you're like me and play with the numbers a bit, you can see where your dollars today can help most down the line.<\/p>\n<p>A lot can be accomplished in the long term, but you need to see where you are in order to know how best to get ahead.<\/p>",

After months of scrounging for work the year before and earning heaps less as a result, we learned we were receiving a sizable sum in the form of a tax refund. Turned out I had been on a compulsory savings plan without knowing it. Hooray.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we certainly could have used that money the year before, when we were counting each cent!<\/p>\n<p>In any event, now the question was – even before the refund was deposited into our account – how best to spend it?<\/p>\n<p>Many of you will have experienced something similar: a refund, an inheritance, a bonus. As soon as you hear of unexpected funds coming your way, a tiny accountant inside your head starts to spin around on a desk chair. The wheels start turning.<\/p>\n<p>Now normally, that little accountant keeps everything in its rightful place: income flows in and gets earmarked for this or that. Mortgage money, car money, beer money – whatever you’ve decided.<\/p>\n<p>But with a windfall, the new money hasn’t been tagged, and suddenly there are all sorts of possibilities. Like that trip to Tahiti or Nepal you’ve dreamed of. Instead of simply a rise in family income for the year, this new money is somehow special.<\/p>\n<p>Since <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/news/posts/you-deserve-best-you-really-do\">you deserve the best<\/a> (you really do), it’s easy to justify luxuries that you would never have normally considered. It’s also easy, since this money is somehow extraordinary, to keep it and spend it in a completely different way than the everyday money you’ve got coming in.<\/p>\n<p>But what makes the most sense for your situation? And cents, for that matter?<\/p>\n<p>Financially speaking, the best place to put it would be towards whatever pushes your <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/net-worth\">net worth<\/a> higher. The higher your net worth, the better position you’ll be in to reach your goals and the more you’ll be able to weather any storms that come your way.<\/p>\n<p>Now you might think that <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/investing\">investing<\/a> your windfall would be best for your finances, but if you are carrying debt, you’ll typically get more bang for your buck by paying it off first. And you won’t need to deal with the risk that comes with investing, either.<\/p>\n<p>If you find yourself with dumb debt on your books, which has some of the highest interest rates around, your windfall could ease the burden that comes with that debt. Our <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/debt\">debt calculator<\/a> can help you figure out just how much interest you’ll save by increasing your payments.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a mortgage, it could be a good candidate for your newfound money. Sorted’s <a href=\"https://sorted.org.nz/#/tools\">mortgage calculator<\/a> can give you an idea of how much you would save if you used your windfall to help tackle your mortgage. You could save thousands, or even tens of thousands, by the time you’re done. And speaking of being done, you can also use the tool to find out how much faster you’d finish paying it off.<\/p>\n<p>Since we were not carrying any significant debt, our tax refund went right into an interest-paying savings account, which effectively became our emergency fund. At Sorted we typically recommend setting aside three months of expenses to stay ready for those unexpected turns in life that are bound to happen.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of – in the past few weeks I suddenly had to fly overseas to be with my ailing grandfather – probably one of the most important journeys I’ve ever made. (He and I have ourselves a deal: he came out here to New Zealand when I got married, so I try to keep my end of the bargain and turn up as well.)<\/p>\n<p>Wouldn’t you know it – it was the emergency fund that gave me the option to cover the travel without borrowing at all. I wouldn’t have missed it for anything.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"first\"><strong>Top things to consider using your windfall for:<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>Expensive debt<a id=\"lexicon-term-dumb_debt\" class=\"lexicon-term label glossary-tip-opener tip-opener glossarytip-label\" href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/glossary#Dumb_debt\"><\/a><\/strong> – if you’re carrying any, it’s a drag.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your mortgage<\/strong> – cutting it back can save thousands and get you finished quicker.<\/p>\n<p><strong>An emergency fund<\/strong> – if you haven’t yet set aside three months of expenses, here’s your chance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your goals<\/strong> – what dreams have you been working towards?<\/p>",

Just as you would turn on the taps and make sure more water flows in than out, with your money you bring in the income and make sure more stays in than goes out.<\/p>\n<p>If you forget the plug and spend more than you earn, the bath never fills.<\/p>\n<p>But even if you put the plug in, you may still find that the bath never fills very high for very long. Do you find yourself wondering where your money is actually going?<\/p>\n<p>If you’re like me, your bath may have sprung some leaks – your everyday spending keeps draining it and stops it from filling as high as it could.<\/p>\n<h4>So much month left at the end of the money<\/h4>\n<p>It's practically impossible to remember what we spend money on every day. It's even harder to keep a running tally of what we've spent on one kind of thing over the last week or month, like takeaways, snacks on the go, groceries or clothes. Can you remember what you spent on movies in the past month, for instance?<\/p>\n<p>Little by little, our spending here and there on things we don’t even think about makes that bath leak without us noticing.<\/p>\n<p>What we all need is a way to see where our money's flowing. That's what <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/money-tracking\">money tracking<\/a>is all about. Tracking your spending can give you a clear picture of what's really happening with your cash.<\/p>\n<h4>Four ways to follow your funds<\/h4>\n<p>Now there are different ways to do this. You can:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Carry a small notebook and write down how much you spend every time you buy something<\/li>\n<li>Use an app to record everything you spend on your phone or tablet<\/li>\n<li>Keep receipts and then write down your expenses at the end of each day<\/li>\n<li>Use EFTPOS for everything you buy and then go through your statements<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>One trick I’ve found is downloading the last three months of statements online. I can easily sort through everything I’ve spent. Since we all tend to return to the same places over and over to shop, it’s simple to see how much I’m spending on entertainment or at the local dairy.<\/p>\n<p>The key is to find a way that works for you and stick to it. You'll be glad you did.<\/p>\n<p>The more accurate your money tracking is, the sharper the picture you'll see of where your money's flowing. It pays not to miss a thing.<\/p>\n<p>As you record each expense, group them by what they are for, like groceries, takeaways, entertainment, petrol, transport fares, clothes, gifts, household bills– whatever you typically spend money on. If you're using a notebook or spreadsheet, make a column for each, so it’s easy to add up.<\/p>\n<h4>Get ready for a real eye-opener<\/h4>\n<p>When you do your sums, get ready for some surprises. You may even be shocked at how much you spend on some everyday things.<\/p>\n<p>But wherever the surprise leaks are, that's where your opportunities are, too.<\/p>\n<p>You'll be able to see where your money is actually flowing and make some important choices about where you want your money to go instead.<\/p>\n<p>And as you plug those leaks, you'll see your bath fill.<\/p>",

Want to make getting debt-free, saving an emergency fund or paying off your mortgage quicker more of a sure thing? Show your written goals to those you’re close to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now I certainly wouldn’t say that I’ve stayed happily married for a dozen years just because I signed my life away with family and friends around, but I like to think that putting pen to paper was a good start. (The party was even better.)<\/p>\n<p>Signatures, of course, can be legally binding – think of all the marriage certificates and mortgage documents out there designed to make sure those agreements get kept. And despite divorces and defaults, the signature system is still around after all these years – and apparently still works.<\/p>\n<p>Yet there’s something else that also happens when we put things in writing.<\/p>\n<h4>A simple formula<\/h4>\n<p>When people take action by writing down a goal, they take action and try to reach it. And as we’re setting personal goals for our finances, we can make this work for us.<\/p>\n<p>Here’s the simplest, most effective formula I’ve found so far for writing down goals:<\/p>\n<p><strong>      “I will have [an amount] for [my goal] by [this date].”<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It’s a powerful statement. Just insert the amount you’re saving, the reason you’re saving it, and the date you’ll have it done by.<\/p>\n<p>And human nature – and behavioural economics – being what they are, odds are you’ll find yourself trying to act in a way that’s consistent with what you’ve written down. You’ll find money here and there, set it aside to meet your goal and make sure that you’re on track.<\/p>\n<p>A good goal is specific and has a time limit, and the above formula makes it easy. <\/p>\n<h4>Keep it real<\/h4>\n<p>The other thing that goals have to be is realistic. They have to be achievable. You don’t want to be setting yourself up for failure, right?<\/p>\n<p>It’s worth revisiting your goals every six months or once a year to check if you are still on track to achieve them. That’s yet another advantage to having them written down.<\/p>\n<h4>Tell the team<\/h4>\n<p>Everyone knows how peer pressure works in a negative way – making us do things just because everyone else happens to be, pressuring us to keep up with all those Joneses.<\/p>\n<p>But we can also make peer pressure work <em>for<\/em> us instead: helping us achieve the goals we choose ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>By showing those close to us what our goals are and when we intend to achieve them, we subtly use them to hold us accountable. Not like a taskmaster or anything, but a helpful reality check and a reminder.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you’re sitting down with your partner or bringing the whole whānau together to discuss goals and put them in writing, the mutual support you receive can be extremely helpful.<\/p>\n<p>Inspiring even. <\/p>",

I think it was a present for someone around here once, and although I suspect the fine was never charged, perhaps the gift itself was enough to cause the desired change.<\/p>\n<p>But if not, I’m sure that the $5 penalty per whinge would have worked its magic.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes we all need something really bad to threaten us before we budge, since our brains are hard-wired to either seek rewards or avoid pain. We’re always going to resist making changes to our status-quo behaviour or thinking patterns.<\/p>\n<p>That’s where the idea of a swearing jar comes in – you have to pay up each time your tongue slips. (Think of it as a forced savings plan.)<\/p>\n<p>But swearing jars have unintended and often hilarious results if they’re not set up right. For instance, set the penalty too low (say at 50 cents) and it will be ignored. Who cares? Or if the money is set to go toward something really desirable, like a holiday in Tahiti, it will end up encouraging and reinforcing the behaviour instead. Work meetings would get a tad too entertaining, let’s say.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing is, you can’t really set up a swearing jar – or a negative consequence – on your own. (Well you could, but it wouldn’t be much fun.) Who would hold you to paying up and check whether you really made the change permanently? It’s a collective enterprise.<\/p>\n<p>So if you are trying to change your spending or saving habits – like <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/credit-cards\">paying off your credit card in full each month<\/a> or finally getting around to putting aside three months of expenses for your emergency fund – you need something really bad hanging over your head.<\/p>\n<p>For me it would be putting up $300 that my kids would get to spend on anything they want if I didn’t make the change. That would hurt. For you it may be betting against the All Blacks to win at their next outing in Eden Park, or pledging to contribute to the political party you just can’t stand. It could be something really scary, too, like a bungee jump.<\/p>\n<p>Pick your poison and make sure others will hold you accountable.

The goal is to get through the season without racking up dumb debt. The more we avoid this, the more joyful the rest of the year becomes.<\/p>\n<p>Now the ‘dumb’ in ‘dumb debt’ is not about those of us carrying it on our cards; it’s about a certain kind of debt – high-interest borrowing that could have been avoided. Interest rates on many credit cards these days have started <a href=\"http://www.interest.co.nz/borrowing/credit-cards\">to creep above 20%<\/a>, so leaving $900 on your card for nine months, for example, ends up costing you $1,000 instead.

        "Title": "Seen your credit score?",
        "Content": "<p>I’ve a confession to make: I’ve been playing on one of the peer-to-peer lending sites. Not mystery shopping or anything, just the sort of thing we should all do when we’re looking for a loan: find out what’s on offer and compare. Ideally we’d be able to check what a loan will cost us in fees and interest, too.<\/p>\n<p>So I went looking for a $20,000 loan, without having any real pressing need. (Take it from me, this is a lot more fun when you’re not desperate for the money. I’ve been there!)<\/p>\n<p>Two things about this experience shocked me. First, when I was approved, the setup fees and interest rate were nowhere to be seen. I actually had to email someone to ask what borrowing 20 grand was going to cost me.<\/p>\n<p>Then, when I finally found out, my second shock was the rate itself: 22.14%! That’s higher than <a href=\"http://www.interest.co.nz/borrowing/credit-cards\">almost all<\/a> personal loans, car loans, credit cards and even some store cards.<\/p>\n<p>Which brings us to the main point of this post: <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/your-credit-history\">credit history<\/a> and credit scores. I began wondering why I was being offered such a high rate, so I ran my credit history to see. Although I had no idea what the lender was looking for in a borrower in terms of score, perhaps I could guess why I might not fit the bill.<\/p>\n<p>Now checking your credit history is fairly easy these days, but you have to do it with all three reporting agencies: <a href=\"http://www.centrix.co.nz/Personal.html\">Centrix<\/a>, <a href=\"http://dnb.co.nz/personal.html#.Vl9bw9IrKUk\">Dun and Bradstreet<\/a>, <a href=\"http://mycreditfile.co.nz/compare-our-products\">Veda<\/a>. You have a right to get it for free, or you can pay under $10 to get yours a bit faster (within a week or so).<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, your credit score – the rating that lenders use to decide whether they will lend to you – is not included with your history unless you pay even more. For your “Vedascore”, for example, you’d have to either pay a one-time fee of $51.95 or start up their alerts for $7.95 a month.<\/p>\n<p>When I ran my credit history, it included the record of my P2P loan application. Too much shopping for credit like this is one of the things that can drive your score down.<\/p>\n<h4>What else can negatively affect your score? Here’s a list:<\/h4>\n<ul><li>Defaulting on a loan<\/li>\n<li>Not paying after defaulting<\/li>\n<li>Any insolvency history<\/li>\n<li>Having too short a credit history<\/li>\n<li>Not having enough experience with different credit “products” like cards and hire purchase agreements<\/li>\n<li>Requesting credit too many times from different lenders within a short period<\/li>\n<li>Living at your present address for too short a time<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Since I’ve shifted house a couple of times in the last two years, I suspect that my high P2P rate was due to that last point. Or perhaps it is too short a history, since there’s really not much on it. I’ll never know, since lenders’ credit decisions always have a veil of secrecy about them.<\/p>\n<p>Happily, there are some things we can do to improve our credit rating and get cheaper credit when we need it. Since April 2012 New Zealand has been putting a positive reporting system in place, with the big banks, utility companies and telecoms starting to report our good payment habits over the last two years to the credit agencies.<\/p>\n<p>So the more often we pay our bills on time – and of course avoid defaults or anything negative – the more our credit score will climb.<\/p>\n<p>But all of this still leaves me wondering why I can get my credit history for free, but not my score. I still haven’t seen mine. <\/p>",

As I look for international organisations to donate to this year, I thought I’d also support something closer to home by spotlighting microfinance here.<\/p>\n<p>There are a number of brilliant efforts across the country that offer no-cost or low-cost borrowing solutions to those in need. This is called “microfinance” because of the small loan amounts involved (typically below $5,000, but some go much higher). These loans are specifically for certain circumstances, but they are undoubtedly a real opportunity for some.<\/p>\n<div class=\"side-bar-text\">\n<h3>Microfinance is a true gift.<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<p>Since most of us borrow <a href=\"http://www.interest.co.nz/borrowing/personal-loan\">so expensively<\/a> on conventional cards and loans with nosebleed interest rates and fees, microfinance solutions are a true gift.<\/p>\n<p>The word on the street, surprisingly, is that there’s a lot of microfinance money sloshing around looking for a home.

With a smaller proportion of your repayments going to interest, so much more can go to paying down principal.<\/p>\n<p>Understandably, some see low interest rates as a season to take on even more debt. When they are low, it feels like you can afford much more house. But interest rates that go down generally come up again, so it’s a time to make it work for you.<\/p>\n<p>I once asked a friend whether he realised how mortgages are set up in the lender’s favour, not the borrower’s. It’s easy to just carry on making the minimum payment over the full term of the <a id=\"lexicon-term-loan\" class=\"lexicon-term label glossary-tip-opener tip-opener glossarytip-label\" href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/glossary#Loan\">loan<\/a>. But you end up paying the highest amount of interest over the longest amount of time. What you want, instead, is to pay the least amount of interest over the shortest amount of time.<\/p>\n<p>Banks give us a variety of options, but the trick is to be aware of how much of our choice ends up being a gift to your bank. It’s the gift that keeps on giving – paying lots of interest over many years!<\/p>\n<p>As a borrower, the default settings of a loan will probably not be as much in your favour as they could be. Happily, you don’t need to be locked in to making the minimum payment – you can <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/mortgage-manager\">decide what’s right for you<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now my friend’s first reaction to all of this was intriguing: at first he felt I was trying to limit his lifestyle by decreasing the day-to-day play money he had.<\/p>\n<p>What I was really aiming to do was expand the way he lived by freeing him up from debt sooner. As we talked, he began to see things differently. A change of perspective certainly helps – especially for something with such long-term consequences as a mortgage.<\/p>\n<p>Finding $100 more a fortnight to repay a $300,000 mortgage at 5%, for instance, you can save close to $29,700 and be done almost three years earlier. <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/mortgage-manager\">You can run your numbers here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So this season, take advantage. The more we dial down our debt, the more we dial up our future freedom.<\/p>",

The local mall is now on notice: she is armed with intent.<\/p>\n<p>Wouldn’t you know it, days later it was declined at the dairy after she forgot to check her balance – a hard but important lesson. But perhaps the most unsettling thing was the way she bragged to her brothers that she had a credit card! I quickly intervened. Let’s just call these teachable moments, shall we?<\/p>\n<p>There are a number of <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/blog/dancing-around-debt-traps\">debt traps to dance around<\/a>. Transferring your debt from one credit card to another, for instance, can be a good way to save hundreds of dollars because of a lower interest rate. But this can come with some unpleasant surprises, so you need to understand how transfers work.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/debt#tab-credit-card\">Sorted’s debt calculator<\/a> can show you whether a transfer will save you money and how much. You can also see how much quicker you could be out of debt entirely.<\/p>\n<p>When you transfer your credit card balance, your new bank pays the debt on your old card, and now you owe them the money. That comes with conditions: the most important of which is how long that special rate is good for. If you carry your transferred balance beyond that, you’ll fall into paying a much higher rate all over again.<\/p>\n<p>It gets more complicated when you start to make purchases and cash advances on your new card after your transfer. These are not typically part of the low-rate deal, so you’ll be hit with the standard, higher rate.<\/p>\n<p>And when you make payments, hoping to clear those higher rate purchases or cash advances, you’ll find that your payments are used to pay the lowest-interest rate debt (that amount you initially transferred) first. So you’re still left with the amounts owing at the higher rate. That’s how it works.<\/p>\n<p>But the biggest debt trap? Leaving your old card open instead of cutting it up. That’s one of the easiest ways ever to fall deeper into debt – having that old credit limit still there just waiting to be run up all over again. You end up carrying debt on two cards.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, you’re in control here. By dancing around these debt traps, you can make sure your credit card is working for you and not the other way around.<\/p>",

        "Content": "<p>Imagine you’re holding a dollar in your hand. Where best to put it? The short answer is wherever it gets you the most back.<\/p>\n<p>So what would help you get ahead more – being in KiwiSaver or paying off your debt quicker?<\/p>\n<p>Whenever you pay off debt, you are saving yourself the interest you would have paid and moving yourself in the right direction financially. If it’s a credit card, that’s like getting a sure 20% return for your money. If it’s a mortgage, think of it as a 6% return to you when you put that extra dollar there.<\/p>\n<div class=\"side-bar-text\">\n<h3>Now that the kick-start is no longer around, does that change the way things look? Not really.<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<p>But how does that compare with what you get if you put that dollar in KiwiSaver? And now that the $1,000 kick-start is no longer around, does that change the way things look?<\/p>\n<p>Since your KiwiSaver money is invested for you in a fund, it <a href=\"http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/funds/growth/returns/\">can earn you returns each year<\/a>. As we ran the numbers for this, we used a balanced return of 4.4% after fees and taxes are paid. So if you looked at just KiwiSaver investment earnings, which are difficult to predict, it would be a better choice to pay off debt.<\/p>\n<p>But with KiwiSaver, on top of your investment earnings, there is also the government’s contribution. Even though the $1,000 kick-start is no longer there, for every dollar you put into KiwiSaver, you get an extra 50 cents, <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/bigfivehundy\">up to $521 each year<\/a>. In that first year, that is basically like getting a 50% return for the $1,043 you put in.<\/p>\n<p>You also get your employer’s contributions that match the first 3% you put in.<\/p>\n<p>So altogether, say if you were on $50,000 per year and contributing 3% of your salary, thanks to the government and <a id=\"lexicon-term-employer_contributions\" class=\"lexicon-term label glossary-tip-opener tip-opener glossarytip-label\" href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/glossary#Employer_contributions\">employer contributions<\/a> adding to the investment earnings, you would be looking at a 117% return over the year. That’s way better value than paying off debt, and to find any other investment that’s guarantees a similar return is impossible (you may want to run the other way if someone offers one!).<\/p>\n<p>Now, let’s say you had a mortgage of $250,000 and you joined KiwiSaver while you paid it off.  After 30 years you’d end up with the mortgage paid and a KiwiSaver balance of $289,000. <\/p>\n<p>But what if you took your KiwiSaver contributions and made higher mortgage repayments? Say you paid it off, then joined KiwiSaver and put your mortgage repayments into KiwiSaver to catch up on your retirement savings. Well, after 30 years your KiwiSaver balance would still only be $203,000.<\/p>\n<p>So in the end, the answer to the question “KiwiSaver <em>or <\/em>debt?” is actually “KiwiSaver <em>and<\/em>debt”.

My daughter tried her hand at Lego, and the two boys built an entire skate park for their “tech decks” – tiny finger-sized skateboards.<\/p>\n<p>Suddenly the boys were back on the tablet and urgently had to show me an auction for 25 fingerboards and a fancy case – closing soon and just $75!<\/p>\n<p>And we had been doing so well.<\/p>\n<p>What was particularly interesting was that on that sized screen, the toys were almost exactly life-size. It was as if those boys were already holding those tiny boards in their hands.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740813000934\">One study shows<\/a> how when we shop on a touchscreen, we’re much more likely to feel like whatever we find already belongs to us – it’s much more tangible in our minds. This is called the “endowment” effect: we feel like it’s already ours. And we end up valuing a product way more than if we were viewing it on a desktop, for instance.<\/p>\n<p><span>I must say, shopping on tablets and touchscreens is brilliant – convenient, easy, fun. But it’s good to know how your brain works so you can <\/span><a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/a-z-guides/setting-goals\">make sure you’re sticking to the goals you’ve set<\/a><span> and not following someone else’s plans for your hard-earned cash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I quickly reminded my two troublemakers of their goals to save for scooters and electric guitars. Stick to the plan, fellas!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, touchscreens still come nowhere close to the bricks-and-mortar retail experience, which is totally immersive. When you try on that flattering dress or test drive that car, your brain easily lets you feel how good it would be if that were already yours.<\/p>\n<p>Just Saturday we were in the best guitar room in the city, checking out dozens of cool, retro-styled electrics. My 9-year-old budding guitar hero can only just play <em>Smoke on the water<\/em>, but he already knew which six-string was his!<\/p>",

That helps to get things back in control.<\/p>\n<p>There’s a lot been said about managing credit cards. You know: avoid the fees, get the rewards, pay it off in full each month. And slightly more of us (51%) do just that, pay them off every month.<\/p>\n<p>But there’s a credit elephant in the room that we conveniently ignore: it’s that we spend a lot more when it’s on plastic.<\/p>\n<p>How much more? A number of studies show how and why people spend more on credit than with cash, but there’s no consensus as to how much. Some put the figure as high as 30% more, or <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/simester/Public/Papers/Alwaysleavehome.pdf\">even higher<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>Now this is not really a frugality blog, about cutting spending at all costs. It’s about<a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/money-planner\">sticking to a plan and staying on track<\/a>. You need to be in control.<\/p>\n<p>Is this what we want to be doing with our money? Try tracking your credit card purchases for 14 days and see where your money’s flowing, just to make sure.<\/p>\n<p>There’s been ground-breaking work in the field of neuroeconomics – for example, how our brains work differently when we’re using credit than if we were paying with cash.<\/p>\n<p>When we pay with cash, our brains make the trade-off between the pain of parting with our dollars and the pleasure of getting whatever we’re buying. On credit, that pain gets removed from the picture entirely, and it’s all pleasure for the moment.<\/p>\n<p>Our brains are also not very good at keeping tabs on all the individual things we spend on, so when that monthly bill comes around, it’s typically more than we thought it would be.<\/p>\n<p>So if you or someone you’re close to is living on a credit card, you may want to try moving to cash, or using real money with a debit card.<\/p>\n<p>That way you stick to your plan – not someone else’s.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>",

And people.<\/p>\n<p>Small successes lead to more success, and snowballing up can make it easier for us to build momentum and get going. Trying to do too much at once, on the other hand, can be demotivating and even paralysing.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to your personal finances, where are the quick wins? I’ve discovered that “getting sorted” is not so much something you do just once and that’s it; there’s always something more you can be sorting out.<\/p>\n<p>If you’re carrying a few different kinds of debt – credit cards, personal loans, car loans, student loans or a mortgage – you may find that paying off the smallest balances first builds a repayment snowball that eventually knocks them all down.<\/p>\n<p>But the other thing to take into account are the interest rates that you’re paying on each of your debts. Which is the most expensive? If you list yours in order of interest rates, you can see where it’s easiest to save the most money: by paying off the highest rate first, then the next highest, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Sorted’s <a href=\"https://www.sorted.org.nz/calculators/debt\">debt calculator<\/a> can help you figure out the quickest way out of debt.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing to consider is how much time you have to get things done. Last weekend I was shifting house with a close friend’s help, and we started with the lighter stuff first. But moving always takes longer than planned, and we were running out of time before we could get to load what seemed like the heaviest washing machine ever…<\/p>\n<p>I guess we can’t let doing what’s easy first become an excuse for putting off the most important stuff.<\/p>",
